## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Command Execution ⌨️
**Status:** Already implemented, working correctly

Agents with `commandExecution` capability can:
- Execute terminal/shell commands
- Get real-time output (stdout/stderr)
- Track execution history
- Use safe execution with blocked dangerous commands

**Files involved:**
- `/src/electron/services/CommandExecutor.ts` (existing)
- Integration in `AgentManager.ts`

---

### 2. Desktop Viewing 🖥️
**Status:** Newly implemented ✨

Agents with `computerControl` capability can now:
- **See EXACTLY what's on the desktop** via screenshots
- Get screen dimensions
- Analyze visual information
- Make decisions based on what they see

**Implementation:**
- Screenshots captured during agent decision loop
- Integrated with `AutomationService.ts`
- Screen size included in agent context
- Base64 encoded image data available

**Files modified:**
- `/src/electron/services/AgentManager.ts` (lines 254-264, 296-300)
- `/src/electron/main.ts` (added automation:screenshot handler)

---

### 3. Sidebar Icon Fix 🎨
**Status:** Fixed ✨

**Problem:** Emojis were showing as square boxes (□) instead of proper icons

**Solution:**
- Added proper emoji font family support
- Includes fallbacks: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Noto Color Emoji
- Fixed icon sizing and alignment
- Works across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Files modified:**
- `/src/renderer/styles.css` (lines 34-38, 86-92)

---

### 4. User Prompting System 💬
**Status:** Newly implemented ✨

Agents can now ask questions and interact with users!

**Features:**
- 4 prompt types: Question, Confirmation, Choice, Approval
- Visual dialog system with modal overlay
- Queue management for multiple prompts
- Automatic timeout (5 minutes)
- Full history tracking

**New files created:**
- `/src/electron/services/UserPromptService.ts` (233 lines)
- `/src/renderer/components/UserPromptDialog.tsx` (180 lines)

**Files modified:**
- `/src/electron/services/AgentManager.ts` (ASK_USER action handling)
- `/src/electron/main.ts` (IPC handlers)
- `/src/electron/preload.ts` (API exposure)
- `/src/renderer/App.tsx` (integrated dialog component)

**How it works:**
1. Agent decides it needs user input
2. Sends ASK_USER action with question
3. UserPromptService creates prompt and queues it
4. UserPromptDialog shows modal to user
5. User responds
6. Response returned to agent
7. Agent continues with user's answer

---

### 5. Autonomy Levels 🎚️
**Status:** Enhanced and fully implemented ✨

**Previous:** Existed but didn't control behavior
**Now:** Fully enforces approval requirements

#### Low Autonomy
- ❗ Requires approval for EVERYTHING
- Commands: ✋ Approval required
- Messages: ✋ Approval required  
- Task delegations: ✋ Approval required
- Can ask user questions anytime

#### Medium Autonomy
- ⚠️ Balanced approach
- Commands: ✋ Approval required
- Messages: ✅ Automatic
- Task delegations: ✅ Automatic
- Can ask user questions anytime

#### High Autonomy
- 🚀 Fully autonomous
- Commands: ✅ Automatic
- Messages: ✅ Automatic
- Task delegations: ✅ Automatic
- Cannot ask user questions (operates independently)

**Implementation:**
- Approval checks in `AgentManager.ts` (lines 328-425)
- Visual indicators in `CreateAgentModal.tsx`
- Documentation in help text

---

### 6. Agent-to-Agent Communication 🤝
**Status:** Already implemented, verified working

Agents can:
- Send messages to specific agents or broadcast
- Delegate tasks to other agents
- Share data through shared memory
- Track message history
- Use priority levels

**Files involved:**
- `/src/electron/services/AgentCommunication.ts` (existing)
- `/src/electron/services/AgentManager.ts` (integration)

**Features:**
- Message types: request, response, notification, data
- Broadcast support
- Read receipts
- Shared memory with permissions
- Data expiration

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Creating an Interactive Agent
```typescript
const agent = await window.electronAPI.agent.create({
  name: "Interactive Assistant",
  description: "Helps with tasks, asks when unsure",
  llmProvider: "openai_123",
  model: "gpt-4",
  systemPrompt: "You are helpful. Ask user for clarification.",
  capabilities: {
    computerControl: true,    // Can see desktop
    fileSystem: true,
    network: true,
    agentCommunication: true,
    commandExecution: true    // Can run commands
  },
  config: {
    autonomyLevel: 'medium'   // Asks before commands
  }
});
```

### Agent Behavior with Medium Autonomy
```
1. Agent wants to check system status
   → Runs: df -h
   → User prompted: "Execute command: df -h"
   → User approves
   → Command executes
   → Agent sees output

2. Agent wants to notify another agent
   → Sends message automatically
   → No approval needed

3. Agent needs clarification
   → Uses ASK_USER action
   → User sees: "Which directory should I use?"
   → User responds: "/home/user/documents"
   → Agent continues with answer
```
