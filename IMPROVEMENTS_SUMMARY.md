# Improvements Summary

## Overview

Your Autonomous Agent Desktop app has been significantly enhanced with powerful new capabilities that transform it from a single-agent system into a collaborative multi-agent platform with command execution, direct llama.cpp integration, and comprehensive Ollama support.

## üéØ What Was Added

### 1. Inter-Agent Communication System ‚úÖ

**What it does:**
Agents can now communicate with each other, share knowledge, and work together on complex tasks.

**Files Created:**
- `src/electron/services/AgentCommunication.ts` - Complete messaging and shared memory system

**Key Features:**
- Direct messaging between agents
- Broadcast messages to all agents
- Shared memory with access controls
- Task delegation between agents
- Message priority system
- Automatic cleanup of old messages

**Example Use Case:**
A research agent can find information and message a writing agent to create a report, while both agents access shared context from a data collection agent.

### 2. Command Execution System ‚úÖ

**What it does:**
Agents can safely execute terminal commands with multiple safety layers.

**Files Created:**

**Key Features:**
- Execute commands with safety validation
- Block dangerous commands automatically
- Timeout protection (5 minutes default)
- Real-time output capture
- Complete command history
- Running command monitoring
- Agent-specific command tracking

**Example Use Case:**
A DevOps agent can run `npm install`, check logs with `cat`, monitor processes, and execute build commands - all while dangerous operations like `rm -rf /` are automatically blocked.
